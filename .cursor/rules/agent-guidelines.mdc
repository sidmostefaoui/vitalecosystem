Guidelines for how I want the agent to interact with me, what to do and what not to do:

- DON'T RELOAD THE UVICORN WEB SERVER EVER, just tell me to and i'll do it manually.
- When I tell you to create a new database table or modify an existing one, change the create_db.py script, then run this script in the terminal, don't run other commands or create other files.
- By default update existing files yourself without asking me to update them manually.
